/* (IZ 2005-10-27) { 
This folder will be used to save Sessions created by interactive editing of scripts via the ScriptBrowser and Script guis. Each Session is saved under its own name as a script "s" that will create a single copy of that session when s is closed and close + remove that session when s is stopped. 

The idea started on 2005-10-27 and is expected to replace the session saving scheme under develoment which relies on Object.writeArchive. 

Note that session scripts can also be saved on any other folder. If time permits, I will provide options to save the scripts source code together with the session so that it can be loaded entirely independently of the original scripts that were used to create its components. 

I will write some further scripts in this folder as tests to develop this idea further.
