Any MIDI message can be made to perform any action with any object using MIDIHandler.
MIDIHandler together with MIDIListener allow for the interactive binding of incoming MIDI messages to a list of objects. The interface for doing this is given in file: Scripts/Class Documentation/MIDIHandler.

Scripts 25b, 25c, 25d, 25e following the present script in the "About Scripts" folder contain examples of using the MIDIhandler and MIDIListener.
