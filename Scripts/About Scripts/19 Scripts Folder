/* 
The 'Scripts' folder is the default folder for storing Scripts. It must be located in the same folder as the folder that contains the definition of the class 'ScriptBrowser'.  The usual location of the Scripts folder is: 
	SuperCollider_f/SCClassLibrary/Lilt/Scripts
At SuperCollider startup, the ScriptBrowser class reads the paths of all files contained in subfolders of this folder and make these available for browsing, editing, testing, and for loading as scripts.  The Scripts class provides a GUI for doing this.  The use of the Scripts browser is explained in the next section of this documentation ("The Scripts Browser"). 

Methods for loading individual paths of scripts or folders containing scripts from any path, as well as for creating scripts from these are documented in the ScriptBrowser Class help file.
