A "snapshot" is a collection of data that contains the current values of all the Parameters of the Script at the moment that the snapshot was taken. 

To make a snapshot of a Script, type the <enter> key anywhere on that Script's GUI window. 
To see a list of existing snapshots, type the "s" key anywhere on that Script's GUI window. 

To edit the name of a snapshot, use the text field above the list of snapshots. Typing the "backspace" key before doing any other editing on that field will remove the entire existing text. 

To finish editing, type <return>.

To load the selected snapshot from the snapshot list view, type <return> at the list view (with the list view selected). 

To remove a snapshot from the list, type <backspace> at the selected snapshot item. 

A Session automatically saves all existing snapshots of all its Scripts when it is saved as Script to file.
