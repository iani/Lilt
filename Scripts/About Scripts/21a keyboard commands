/* (IZ 2005-10-24) {

For most items in list views, the enter key and backspace key actions are: 

- enter: create new instance of item from selected list item
- backspace (delete): remove selected item from list.

Additionally, the 3 keys: return, escape, and space can be used either alone or with one of 
2 "modifier keys" pressed simultaneously: control and shift. This creates a maximum of 3 x 3 = 9 
possible additional keyboard shortcuts for each item.  

These are organized according to a uniform scheme using the 5 keys return, escape, space, enter, and backspace (delete), by themselves or combined with the shift and control "modifier keys" .

PLAIN: When a key is used without a modifier it refers to the main 
	action of the selected item in the view (mostly start / stop).
SHIFT: When a key is used with the shift key it refers to the GUI
	of the selected item in the view (open / close GUI window).
CONTROL: When a key is used with the control key it refers to the MIDI
	binding of the selected item in the view (activate / deactivate).

So the actions corresponding to keyboard commands can be summarized in the following table: 

modifier key pressed:  none         | shift          | control:
- return: =            start script | open GUI       | activate MIDI
- escape: =             stop script | close GUI      | deactivate MIDI
- space: =            toggle script | toggle GUI     | toggle MIDI

(Note: "toggle" means switch to the opposite of the current status as follows: 
running/visible/activated <-> stopped/closed/deactivated)

The above is a mnemonic guide. The actual actions vary according to the context of the items selected in each view. More details are found in the documentation of the individual GUI windows and views.
