/* IZ 2007-01-27 { SC3

A SynthDef that is loaded by SynthDefs in its list of SynthDefs can generate a default Script for starting Synths and controlling all their inputs, by typing "s" on the selected SynthDef's name in the SynthDefs browser. The new Script is created inside the currently selected folder in the ScriptBrowser. It is not automatically saved to file, but must be saved to file manually, by clicking on the Save button in the ScriptBrowser. From there on, it can be used as any other Script,  or be modified to add more specific behavior. 

(Future versions of Lilt will work towards creating a Script from any SynthDef and making a test instance of that Script "on the fly" for testing purposes. Then the code of the newly generated Script can be edited with the already implemented keyboard command "e" on the opened GUI of that Script. The future version should allow for adding specs to a SynthDef to enable the customization of ranges of values for the input parameters of the SynthDef (i.e. customization of the controlSpecs of the Script).
