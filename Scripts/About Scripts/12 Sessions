Sessions are a powerful tool for grouping Scripts, linking the Synth output of Scripts to the inputs of other Scripts, and saving such configurations.

A Session organizes its Scripts in script-groups. A Session can contain any number of script-groups and a script-group can contain any number of Scripts. 

Every Script that is created is automatically stored in the current Script group of the current Session.

A Session can only have one Server, where all of its Scripts will run. If you need to combine more than one Server, open more than one Sessions. Any number of Sessions can be open at any time, on the same or on different servers. 

There is a gui window for browsing all open sessions and their script-groups and for opening gui-windows for the script groups. Scripts can be added to the currently selected script group by typing the enter key on the currently selected Script in the Script Browser. There exists several keyboard commands for opening and closing guis and for starting and stopping scripts from the Session gui as well as from the script-group guis. 

A Session can automatically generate a script that recreates it. The session gui provides a menu items for saving a Session as a Script and for reload it from that Script file. Things saved by a Session on its save-script are: 

- The name of the Session 
- The Server of the Session
- The script-groups and their names
- The Scripts of each script-group and their names
- The input-output connections (links) between Scripts of this group
- Snapshots of the parameters of each script taken by typing the "enter" key on the gui of a script.
- The positions of the gui windows of each script at the last time they were open.
--- Under development: 
- MIDI bindings for controlling the Scripts of the session and their parameters
