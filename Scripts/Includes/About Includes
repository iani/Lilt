/* IZ 2007-01-26 { SC3

This folder contains files holding templates of code that can be used by other scripts.

The file SessionLoad.include is used by all Scripts generated by Session, which recreate a Session as saved. 

Other useful code can be saved here for inclusion in any script. To include a script a in another script b, 
write inside the script of script b the statement: 
	~script.include(<b folder>, <b name>);
where <b folder> is the name of the folder containing script b, 
and <a folder> is the name of the file of script b, (without the ending portion after the .).

DO NOT REMOVE OR RENAME THIS FOLDER BECAUSE Session REQUIRES IT FOR SAVING / LOADING
